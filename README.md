# Fitting prototype with pints

This repo contains a copy of the SVN repo at https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/trac/browser/chaste/projects/AidanDaly (may require login).

It provides the Python back-end for the fitting prototype, based on WL1 code.

The code has been adapted to perform MCMC using Pints, rather than with a custom built routine.

This is meant as a proof-of-principle that the current Pints architecture is suitable for use with WL2.
